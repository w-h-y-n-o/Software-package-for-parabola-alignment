# Software-package-for-parabola-alignment
Software package for parabola reconciliation using the search method

The software package consists of three programs:
1. "search_method" - the main program that implements the search optimization method for solving a nonlinear programming problem
2. "modelling" - a program that simulates the initial data for "search_method"
3. "gui" - visual graphical interface

file "data.xlsx" - contains the source data for "modelling"
file "parabola.dwg" - contains the final result output in Autocad
